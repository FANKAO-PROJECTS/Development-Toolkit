## Features

- **Language Coverage**: Includes snippets for Java, Python, JavaScript, and more.
- **Framework Specific**: Tailored snippets for frameworks like Spring, Django, and React.
- **Real-World Use Cases**: Every snippet is built with practicality in mind, suitable for real-world applications.
- **Community Driven**: Open to contributions from developers across the globe.

## Usage

Here's a brief guide on how to utilize the snippets in your projects:

1. **Choose a Snippet**: Navigate through the categorized folders to find the snippet that suits your need.
2. **Review the Snippet**: Each snippet includes a README with implementation details.
3. **Integrate the Snippet**: Follow the instructions to integrate the snippet into your project.

### Example: Integrating a Spring Boot Controller

1. **Copy the Code**: Copy the `ExampleController.java` file from `java/spring/` directory.
2. **Add to Project**: Paste the file into your Spring Boot project's appropriate package (e.g., `com.example.controller`).
3. **Modify as Needed**: Customize the controller methods and mappings as per your project requirements.
